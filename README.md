Strichliste
===========

[![Managed with Taiga](https://taiga.io/media/support/attachments/article-22/banner-gh.png)](https://tree.taiga.io/project/don42-strichliste-django/ "Managed with Taiga")

This project is a rewrite of the [Strichliste](https://github.com/hackerspace-bootstrap/strichliste/) project in Django. 
Only the backend will be reimplemented. The goal is to reuse the existing frontend with some necessary changes.

This version is HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL and should not be used in a production environment.
